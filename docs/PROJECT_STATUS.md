Completion here refers to the accepted scope of each historical task. It does not imply that every component is integrated into a V1 workflow or release-ready.

## M3.6b validation evidence

- Focused historical coverage tests: 25 passed
- All market-data tests: 51 passed
- Full suite: 111 passed
- `git diff --check`: passed
- Implementation commit: `1e8065a Add historical coverage planner`

## M3.6c validation evidence

- Focused M3.6c/store tests: 57 passed
- All market-data tests: 99 passed
- Full suite before commit: 159 passed
- Full suite after commit `1c4a877`: 159 passed
- `git diff --check`: passed
- Implementation commit: `1c4a877 Add local-first historical retrieval`

The accepted M3.6c contract keeps persistent retrieval coverage separate from stored candles. Fully covered requests avoid provider calls, and uncovered requests fetch only missing retrieval ranges. Confirmed-empty coverage is valid evidence; partial results persist only explicit coverage; and provider failures or results without coverage evidence create no false claim. Accepted candles and coverage are persisted transactionally.

Service requests and coverage use half-open `[start, end)` intervals while SQLite candle reads remain inclusive. A `DatasetContext` cannot mix naive and aware persisted timestamps, but different aware offsets remain supported through Python datetime semantics. Equivalent aware timestamps for the same instant are one candle identity, with the first stored representation retained. No timezone normalization was introduced.

## M3.6d validation evidence

- Focused M3.6d integration suite: 11 passed
- M3.6 coverage/store/retrieval/integration neighborhood: 93 passed
- All market-data tests: 110 passed
- Full suite: 170 passed
- Post-commit full suite: 170 passed
- `git diff --check`: passed
- Validation commit: `dc5bda3 Add M3.6d integration validation`
- Production code changes: none

The integration evidence proves that complex cold retrieval becomes durable warm retrieval and that fully covered durable state avoids provider calls. Earlier accepted gaps survive a later provider failure, rollback is scoped to the failing provider result, and partial retrieval resumes only the actual remaining gaps. Raw overlapping or touching coverage is reconciled by the planner. Incompatible persisted/request awareness fails before provider access, while legacy same-instant cross-offset duplicate rows are rejected rather than repaired. Half-open service boundaries remain correct after durable reload, confirmed-empty coverage remains durable evidence, and `DatasetContext` isolation holds across complete retrieval lifecycles.

M3.6d required no production correction. The existing M3.6c implementation satisfied all new integration cases.

## M3.7a validation evidence

- Implementation commit: `073f3e9 Add historical source policy contract`
- Focused M3.7a: 16 passed
- M3.6 + M3.7a neighborhood: 109 passed
- All market-data: 126 passed
- Full suite: 186 passed
- `git diff --check`: passed

M3.7a establishes explicit `LOCAL_ONLY`, `LOCAL_FIRST` and `PROVIDER_BACKED` policies. `LOCAL_ONLY` never invokes a provider. Warm `LOCAL_FIRST` also avoids provider construction, while missing coverage lazily creates one provider and reuses it across every missing gap. `PROVIDER_BACKED` always accesses the provider for the complete request, and completion depends only on that call's explicit coverage; old local coverage cannot mask partial provider evidence. Confirmed-empty provider evidence is valid.

Provider-backed persistence remains non-destructive, and no refresh or replacement policy was introduced. `RuntimeMode` remains independent. M3.7a added no broker, AngelOne, HistoricalFeed, main, backtest or WFA wiring, and introduced no timestamp normalization or expected-bar, calendar or session inference.

## M3.7b validation evidence

- Implementation commit: `b6a4fff Add broker historical provider adapter`
- Pre-change full suite: 186 passed
- Focused HistoricalFeedProvider: 10 passed
- Focused AngelOne historical: 10 passed
- HistoricalFeed regressions: 15 passed
- M3.7 neighborhood: 90 passed
- All market-data: 136 passed
- Broker neighborhood: 10 passed
- Full suite: 206 passed
- `git diff --check`: passed

`HistoricalFeedProvider` implements the accepted `HistoricalProvider` shape by composing `HistoricalFeed`; it does not duplicate broker chunking. HistoricalFeed remains authoritative for broker limits, chunk traversal, overlap handling, duplicate and conflict detection, chronology, and stream-awareness validation. A successfully completed retrieval returns explicit `coverage=(request,)` based on operation completion rather than candle count or spacing, so sparse and confirmed-empty results remain valid evidence.

The adapter includes a candle at `request.start`, excludes an exact `request.end` candle under half-open `[start, end)` semantics, and rejects other out-of-range candles rather than clipping them. Failed streams return no result or manufactured coverage, including failures after earlier chunks emitted candles. Request/candle naive-aware incompatibility fails explicitly, with no timestamp normalization or conversion.

AngelOne now returns `[]` for a valid `data=[]` response. Malformed responses remain errors, and non-empty timestamp/OHLCV parsing remains unchanged. BaseBroker, HistoricalFeed, HistoricalSource, AppConfig, main, backtest and WFA runtime were unchanged. No expected-bar, session, calendar or gap-inference logic was added.

## Current work

M3.7a and M3.7b are complete at their accepted scopes.

M3.7 remains IN_PROGRESS. M3.7c is baselined as READY / NEXT but remains unimplemented; implementation requires separate explicit authorization after this baseline is reviewed and committed. M3.7d remains PLANNED and unimplemented. M3.8 remains RESERVED.

M3.7c will make backtest and WFA retrieve canonical candles through `HistoricalSource` instead of accepting a broker and constructing `HistoricalFeed`. A small composition factory will build the SQLite-backed source immediately while retaining external construction as a lazy provider factory. `LOCAL_ONLY` and warm `LOCAL_FIRST` must load no AngelOne credentials and construct or authenticate no broker; missing `LOCAL_FIRST` and all `PROVIDER_BACKED` retrieval invoke the external factory only when required by the accepted policy contract.

`AppConfig` will own historical source policy, database path and request delay. The accepted V1 defaults are `LOCAL_FIRST`, `data/historical.sqlite3` and the existing request delay. Main will compose the source only for BACKTEST and WALK_FORWARD after selecting the runtime mode. M3.7c does not add historical wiring to PAPER or LIVE.

The repository's default AngelOne-oriented `BACKTEST_CONFIG` will use explicit timezone-aware Asia/Kolkata start/end values. This is example configuration, not automatic localization through `DatasetContext.timezone`; arbitrary naive requests remain valid for compatible naive local data and fail explicitly against incompatible aware provider data.

## Important V1 blockers

- M3.7 historical source policy/runtime wiring;
- historical-path parity and reproducibility;
- backtest validity and reproducible research records;
- WFA termination, configuration propagation, and account-metric validity;
- real-market-data ingestion for paper trading;
- an operational paper-session lifecycle;
- API/frontend integration with actual runtime and research results; and
- completion of all V1 validation and release gates.

Technical findings that are deliberately unresolved are recorded in [Deferred Work](roadmap/DEFERRED_WORK.md). The ordered delivery plan is in the [Roadmap](roadmap/ROADMAP.md).

## Release boundary

V1 does not place real-money broker orders. Live execution is deferred to V2 and requires additional execution, reconciliation, recovery, operational-safety, and external acceptance evidence.
