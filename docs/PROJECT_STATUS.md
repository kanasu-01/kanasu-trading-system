## Completed foundation

- M0 — Repository / foundation hygiene
- M1 — Authoritative simulated portfolio accounting
- M2 and M2.1–M2.4 — Execution economics/accounting correctness
- M3.1 — Candle finite-value validation
- M3.2 — Canonical CSV candle loader
- M3.3a — Dataset identity propagation
- M3.3b — Dataset timezone identity as metadata
- M3.4 — Candle sequence integrity
- M3.5 — Safe historical chunk composition
- M3.6a — SQLite candle persistence
- M3.6b — Coverage and missing-range planning
- M3.6c — Local-first historical retrieval service
- M3.6d — Integration and failure validation
- M3.6 — Local historical persistence and retrieval

Completion here refers to the accepted scope of each historical task. It does not imply that every component is integrated into a V1 workflow or release-ready.

## M3.6b validation evidence

- Focused historical coverage tests: 25 passed
- All market-data tests: 51 passed
- Full suite: 111 passed
- `git diff --check`: passed
- Implementation commit: `1e8065a Add historical coverage planner`

## M3.6c validation evidence

- Focused M3.6c/store tests: 57 passed
- All market-data tests: 99 passed
- Full suite before commit: 159 passed
- Full suite after commit `1c4a877`: 159 passed
- `git diff --check`: passed
- Implementation commit: `1c4a877 Add local-first historical retrieval`

The accepted M3.6c contract keeps persistent retrieval coverage separate from stored candles. Fully covered requests avoid provider calls, and uncovered requests fetch only missing retrieval ranges. Confirmed-empty coverage is valid evidence; partial results persist only explicit coverage; and provider failures or results without coverage evidence create no false claim. Accepted candles and coverage are persisted transactionally.

Service requests and coverage use half-open `[start, end)` intervals while SQLite candle reads remain inclusive. A `DatasetContext` cannot mix naive and aware persisted timestamps, but different aware offsets remain supported through Python datetime semantics. Equivalent aware timestamps for the same instant are one candle identity, with the first stored representation retained. No timezone normalization was introduced.

## M3.6d validation evidence

- Focused M3.6d integration suite: 11 passed
- M3.6 coverage/store/retrieval/integration neighborhood: 93 passed
- All market-data tests: 110 passed
- Full suite: 170 passed
- Post-commit full suite: 170 passed
- `git diff --check`: passed
- Validation commit: `dc5bda3 Add M3.6d integration validation`
- Production code changes: none

The integration evidence proves that complex cold retrieval becomes durable warm retrieval and that fully covered durable state avoids provider calls. Earlier accepted gaps survive a later provider failure, rollback is scoped to the failing provider result, and partial retrieval resumes only the actual remaining gaps. Raw overlapping or touching coverage is reconciled by the planner. Incompatible persisted/request awareness fails before provider access, while legacy same-instant cross-offset duplicate rows are rejected rather than repaired. Half-open service boundaries remain correct after durable reload, confirmed-empty coverage remains durable evidence, and `DatasetContext` isolation holds across complete retrieval lifecycles.

M3.6d required no production correction. The existing M3.6c implementation satisfied all new integration cases.

## Current work

M3.6 — Local Historical Persistence and Retrieval is complete at its accepted scope.

M3.7 — Historical Source Policy / Runtime Wiring is baselined and READY. M3.7a — Historical Source Policy Contract is the next authorized coding task. M3.7b–M3.7d are PLANNED and have not started. M3.8 remains RESERVED.

## Important V1 blockers

- M3.7 historical source policy/runtime wiring;
- historical-path parity and reproducibility;
- backtest validity and reproducible research records;
- WFA termination, configuration propagation, and account-metric validity;
- real-market-data ingestion for paper trading;
- an operational paper-session lifecycle;
- API/frontend integration with actual runtime and research results; and
- completion of all V1 validation and release gates.

Technical findings that are deliberately unresolved are recorded in [Deferred Work](roadmap/DEFERRED_WORK.md). The ordered delivery plan is in the [Roadmap](roadmap/ROADMAP.md).

## Release boundary

V1 does not place real-money broker orders. Live execution is deferred to V2 and requires additional execution, reconciliation, recovery, operational-safety, and external acceptance evidence.
